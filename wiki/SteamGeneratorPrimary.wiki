This model will consist of the primary and secondary sides of the steam
generator (SG).  The boundaries of the primary side model are the hot leg at the SG inlet, the inlet of the RCPs at the SG outlet, and the secondary side of the SG through the tube walls.  

The boundaries of the secondary side model are the primary side through the tube walls and boundary conditions of feedwater flow in and steam 
flow out.  

Additional details will follow. (Updated 2/7/2011)

    * This version of the model represents the shift to using Simscape.
    * Dummy blocks are inserted for the PSG Simscape blocks.

    * Updated secondary model.  Still needs to resolve steam table issues.

    * Nearly complete secondary side model.  Does not include calculation of primary-to-secondary heat transfer, only fed this value.

  * [http://code.google.com/p/panther/downloads/detail?name=SSG_v0.zip&can=2&q= SSG Version 0] (Updated 04/13/2011)
    * Completed secondary side model.  This includes a simple primary load follow calculation to allow the secondary model to achieve a test steady state.  The only remaining task is to add a calculation of the 1st stage turbine pressure.

    * Final secondary side model.  This includes a standalone SSG model for steady state testing and a model ready for integration with the primary side.  The primar-to-secondary heat transfer calculation has been added, as has the calculation of the 1st stage turbine pressure.
