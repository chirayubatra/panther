= Using The Wiki =

Here are some common actions you will need to perform for this course.  If there are other items you would like to see listed here, just email me at jmbrinkhus@gmail.com and I will add them.


== Editing a wiki page ==
To edit a wiki page, follow these instructions:
  * Navigate to the page you wish to edit
  * Click the "Edit this page" button at the top of your wiki page.
  * Make the necessary changes in the text window.
    - If you need help with the wiki markup language, click "show" on Wiki markup help, then click "More examples" to see an extensive help page.  If your editing will take a long time, you might want to open notepad (or your favorite text editor), make your changes there and copy them onto the wiki once you have finished.
  * Then, click the "Preview" button and scroll down to make sure your markup produced the desired look
  * Finally, click "Save page" to commit your changes.

  * Enter a summary description of the file
  * Click the "Choose file" button and browse to the desired file
  * Select the file and click the "Submit file" button

== Linking a File ==
To create a link to an uploaded file from your wiki page, follow these instructions:
  * First, click the "Downloads" tab and locate the file you want to link.
  * Right click the file in the list and select "Copy shortcut"
  * Next, navigate to the page you wish to add the link to and edit it
  * Move the cursor to where you would like to add the link and type first an open bracket '['
  * Then paste your link from the shortcut you copied
  * Then type a space followed by the text you wish to appear in the link
  * Finally, type a closed bracket ']' to complete the syntax for the link
  * Click the "Preview" button to verify that your syntax is correct
  * Click the "Save page" button to finalize your changes
